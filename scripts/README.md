# CNT Scripts

## Overview
This folder is meant to contain any scripts generated in the course of working on a project. This could include the work of multiple invdividuals collaborating on different portions of a project.

At present, we request that users operate within the following guidelines:

1. The basename of each folder follows the naming convention for the repository: (datatype)_(Advisor)_(ProjectName)_
2. Code for different langages are placed into their own subfolders

In the case of this example directory, we assume the root repository naming struture would be: EEG_CONRAD_BENDR00

We do not **require** additional subdirectory structure, but attempts to break down code into logical units/languages/etc. for off-boarding purposes/possible branch mergers is appreciated.
